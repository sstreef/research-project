<h1>Research Project</h1>
A research on the performance and developer experience of applying <i>effect handler oriented programming</i> to IO intensive applications. This project involves 2 experiments that will be compared both qualitatively and quanitatively:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/code/ehop-http-server">A basic http server in Haskell whilst using EHOP.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#">A basic http server in Haskell whilst not using EHOP.</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>How does using effect handler oriented programming affect modularity, readability and maintainability of code for input-output intensive applications when compared to "traditional" implementations?
</p>
<h2>Sub-questions</h2>
The previously defined experiments will be analyzed and compared by evaluating the following sub-questions.
<h3>Qualitative Analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Does using EHOP improve the readability of code compared to the traditional approach of programming?</li>
    <li>Does using EHOP improve the modularity of code compared to the traditional approach of programming?</li>
    <li>Does using EHOP improve the maintainability of code compared to the traditional approach of programming?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantitative Analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Does using EHOP improve startup time compared to a traditional implementation?</li>
    <li>Does using EHOP improve response time compared to a traditional implementation?</li>
    <li>Does using EHOP increase the peak memory usage compared to a traditional implementation?</li>
    <li>Does using EHOP increase the average memory usage compared to a traditional implementation?</li>
</ul>
